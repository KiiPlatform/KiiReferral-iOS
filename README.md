# <a name="intro"/>Introduction to KiiReferral
**KiiReferral** is a tool created by **Kii Labs** that allows you to quickly add social sharing and referral tracking to your app in just a few minutes. The features currently include:

- Generate campaigns and referral links from the developer portal
- Track shares, clicks and conversions in real-time
- Allow users to share links via Facebook, Twitter, SMS and email directly from the app
- Track conversions on a user-level via the SDK
	- Trigger events when conversions occur (i.e. give bonus points, extra features, etc)

# <a name="can-i-add"/>Can I add this to my app?
Currently, **KiiReferral** is only available for iOS, and you must have a developer account set up with **Kii** as well as an application set up within your Kii account (for API keys, etc).

If you don't yet have a **Kii** account, don't worry - it's simple and free to get started. To sign up, visit [developer.kii.com](http://developer.kii.com). 

## <a name="labs-disclaimer"/>Kii Labs & Disclaimer
**KiiReferral** is a project developed and maintained by **Kii Labs**, which provides *beta-level* tools for your use with **Kii**'s cloud functionality. We cannot guarantee these tools will be maintained or grow in a backwards-compatible way - so please use at your own risk and take notice of changes from version to version to avoid issues.

# <a name="setup-usage"/>Setup & Usage
Getting started is easy, and as with **Kii**'s cloud SDKs - the methods and classes are simple and powerful so you can implement using only a few lines of code.

Please visit [the wiki](https://github.com/KiiPlatform/KiiReferral-iOS/wiki) for full implementation guides. For class references, see docs/html/index.html within the repository.
